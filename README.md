### Overview

Easily deploy a server that provides configurable, beautiful analytics for your progressive web app.

The data is yours and plugins which enable realtime actions are on the roadmap.

This is an alpha release a.k.a _flirt, maybe date but certainly don't marry_. i.e. please don't use in a production environment.


### Demo

You can see this project in action at **[here](https://pushify.io)**. Only the latest released version is available and during these early moments, it's just as likely to be broken as not.

### Getting Started


 - Clone this repo
 - Run `docker-compose up`
 - Profit

If you did want to use this for production, follow these steps.

 1. **Please Don't** ðŸ˜¢


### Alternatives

If you're interested in something robust today there are several solutions. They're all pretty good so here's a list of the ones I've discovered so far.  

 - [PushCrew](https://pushcrew.com/)
 - [GoRoost](http://goroost.com/)
 - [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io/)

So even if this project doesn't work for you, there's a lot of options in getting what you want.


### Motivation

Open source allows people to work on what's important and prevents needlessly reinventing the wheel for every organisation that wants to do a little more with their analytics.

With an open sourced option like this one, it's likely the idea you have, already has a plugin. But if it doesn't, feel free to develop one (in the open if possible) and benefit from contributors all around the world.


### Roadmap

Things have been kept intentionally simple. I guess the main thing we need to know is, would this kind of project actually be of use to individuals and organisations (apart from me).

Some assumptions that we've made while building are:
 - Small - Medium sized sites are happy to deploy and host an analytics package if it's made simple enough.

So welcome to the **pre MVP** release ðŸ˜˜

**Still to come:**
 - Live tracking and metrics within dashboard
 - send notifications to visitors and users
 - beahvioural triggers
 - Add roles specific to different accounts.
 - Move towards a _kinda_ almost production ready deployment.
 - Provide simple scaling for larger sites.
 - A plugin architecture for the server, dashboard and client.
 - Docs, docs, and more docs.
 - One click installs.
 - SDKs for mobile platforms (Android and iOS) [maybe].


### Contributing

For now just open up an issue and start hacking on the code. As things develop we'll make this a more formal process.
